# React + Vite


 1. Since I have worked mostly on the frontend part in my company where I have used Javascript and React, I'm not aware of the first question but I'm willing to expand my skillset.

2. I have created a React application using Vite, which includes an api folder providing cacheServices and a components folder containing a CacheManager component that consumes these cache services. I have followed best practices throughout the development process.

- I have used Functional components,
- React hooks for State Management,
- useEffect for API calls
- async await for Web API requests
- try and catch for Error handling
- Axios for get and post requests
